# macOS Privileged Helper with SMAppService - Help Needed! üÜò

This repository contains a proof-of-concept implementation of a privileged helper using Apple's modern `SMAppService` API. Despite following all documented guidelines and implementing numerous fixes suggested by experienced macOS developers, we're encountering a persistent error on macOS 15 beta that we cannot resolve.

**We would greatly appreciate any insights or suggestions from the macOS developer community!**

## TL;DR: The 5 Non-Negotiable Requirements

If your `SMAppService` helper is failing, you have likely missed one of these five critical steps. This guide details each one.

1. **Correct Bundle Structure:** The helper executable and its `launchd.plist` **must** be in `YourApp.app/Contents/Library/LaunchDaemons/`.
2. **Correct `launchd.plist`:** It **must** use the `<key>Program</key>` and the value must be just the helper's filename (e.g., `<string>HelperPOCDaemon</string>`). The path is relative to the plist's location.
3. **Correct Main App `Info.plist`:** It **must** contain the `SMPrivilegedExecutables` key, with a code signing requirement string that exactly matches your helper's signature and Team ID.
4. **Correct Entitlements (Both App & Helper):**
   - **Main App:** Must have the `com.apple.developer.service-management.managed-by-main-app` entitlement.
   - **Helper Daemon:** Must have the `com.apple.security.app-sandbox` entitlement.
5. **Correct Code Signing:** The main app and the helper **must** be signed with the same Developer ID certificate and use the Hardened Runtime.

## What We're Trying to Accomplish

We're building an app that integrates with [Kanata](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata), a cross-platform keyboard remapper. Our macOS implementation requires:

1. Register a privileged daemon using the modern `SMAppService` API (replacing deprecated `SMJobBless`)
2. Execute root-level operations (Kanata requires root access for system-wide keyboard event interception)
3. Communicate with the main app via XPC
4. Work reliably on macOS 14+ (Sonoma, Sequoia)

## The Problem

On macOS 15 beta (Darwin 25.0.0), we consistently get this error:

```
The operation couldn't be completed. Unable to read plist: com.keypath.helperpoc
```

This occurs when calling:
```swift
SMAppService.daemon(plistName: "com.keypath.helperpoc").register()
```

Even more concerning: manual `launchctl` commands also fail with "Input/output error", suggesting a system-level issue.

## Apple Documentation We're Following

We've carefully followed Apple's official documentation:

1. [Updating helper executables from earlier versions of macOS](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/servicemanagement/updating-helper-executables-from-earlier-versions-of-macos)
2. [SMAppService API Reference](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/servicemanagement/smappservice)
3. [Creating a launch daemon](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/servicemanagement/smappservice/daemon(plistname:))

Key requirements from the docs:
- Helper daemon must be in `Contents/Library/LaunchDaemons/`
- Plist must use relative paths for embedded helpers
- Main app must declare `SMPrivilegedExecutables` in Info.plist
- Proper code signing with Developer ID

## Our Implementation

### Bundle Structure ‚úÖ
```
HelperPOCApp.app/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Contents/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Info.plist                    # Contains SMPrivilegedExecutables
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MacOS/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ HelperPOCApp              # Main application
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Library/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ LaunchDaemons/
‚îÇ           ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ HelperPOCDaemon       # Privileged helper executable
‚îÇ           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ com.keypath.helperpoc.plist  # Launch daemon plist
```

### Key Configuration Files

**Main App Info.plist:**
```xml
<key>SMPrivilegedExecutables</key>
<dict>
    <key>com.keypath.helperpoc</key>
    <string>identifier "com.keypath.helperpoc" and anchor apple generic and certificate 1[field.1.2.840.113635.100.6.2.6] /* exists */ and certificate leaf[field.1.2.840.113635.100.6.1.13] /* exists */ and certificate leaf[subject.OU] = "X2RKZ5TG99"</string>
</dict>
```

**Helper Daemon Plist:**
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>com.keypath.helperpoc</string>
    <key>Program</key>
    <string>HelperPOCDaemon</string>
    <key>MachServices</key>
    <dict>
        <key>com.keypath.helperpoc.xpc</key>
        <true/>
    </dict>
    <key>RunAtLoad</key>
    <false/>
    <key>KeepAlive</key>
    <false/>
</dict>
</plist>
```

#### Common `launchd.plist` Mistakes

The `Program` key is critical. Any of these common mistakes will cause `launchctl` to fail with a generic `Input/output error` or `SMAppService` to fail with "Unable to read plist".

```xml
<!-- WRONG: BundleProgram is for other contexts and often fails here. -->
<key>BundleProgram</key>
<string>HelperPOCDaemon</string>

<!-- WRONG: An absolute path will fail because the app bundle is not at a fixed location. -->
<key>Program</key>
<string>/Applications/YourApp.app/Contents/Library/LaunchDaemons/HelperPOCDaemon</string>

<!-- WRONG: A nested path is incorrect because the path is relative to the plist itself. -->
<key>Program</key>
<string>Contents/Library/LaunchDaemons/HelperPOCDaemon</string>
```

## Everything We've Tried

### 1. Plist Path Formats
- ‚ùå `BundleProgram` with nested path: `Contents/Library/LaunchDaemons/HelperPOCDaemon`
- ‚ùå `Program` with absolute path: `/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/com.keypath.helperpoc`
- ‚ùå `Program` with relative path: `HelperPOCDaemon` (current implementation)
- ‚ùå `ProgramArguments` array format

### 2. Code Signing & Notarization
- ‚úÖ Signed with Developer ID Application certificate
- ‚úÖ Helper daemon has explicit identifier: `com.keypath.helperpoc`
- ‚úÖ All signatures verify with `codesign --verify`
- ‚úÖ App is fully notarized and stapled
- ‚úÖ `spctl -a -vvv` shows: "accepted, source=Notarized Developer ID"

### 3. Entitlements Attempted
**Main App Entitlements:**
- ‚úÖ `com.apple.security.app-sandbox = false`
- ‚úÖ `com.apple.security.temporary-exception.mach-lookup.global-name`
- ‚úÖ `com.apple.developer.service-management.managed-by-main-app = true` (suspected new requirement)

**Helper Daemon Entitlements:**
- ‚ùå `com.apple.security.app-sandbox = false` (original)
- ‚ùå `com.apple.security.app-sandbox = true` (tested as potential new requirement)

### 4. Manual Testing
```bash
# Direct plist validation
plutil -lint com.keypath.helperpoc.plist  # Result: OK

# Manual launchctl attempts (all fail with "Input/output error")
sudo launchctl load -w /path/to/plist
sudo launchctl bootstrap system /path/to/plist

# Even with simplified test plists containing absolute paths
```

### 5. System-Level Debugging
- Checked for existing services: `launchctl list | grep keypath` (none found)
- Monitored system logs: `log stream --predicate 'subsystem == "com.apple.servicemanagement"'`
- Verified no quarantine attributes
- Checked extended attributes (found Dropbox attrs, but shouldn't affect functionality)

### How to Verify Your Signatures

Don't just sign and hope. Use these commands in Terminal to verify what the system sees.

**1. Verify the main app's signature and entitlements:**
```bash
codesign -dv --entitlements - /Applications/YourApp.app
```
- Look for `Authority=Developer ID Application: Your Name (YOUR_TEAM_ID)`.
- Look for `TeamIdentifier=YOUR_TEAM_ID`.
- In the Entitlements blob, make sure you see `com.apple.developer.service-management.managed-by-main-app`.

**2. Verify the helper daemon's signature and entitlements:**
```bash
codesign -dv --entitlements - /Applications/YourApp.app/Contents/Library/LaunchDaemons/YourHelper
```
- The `Authority` and `TeamIdentifier` must **match** the main app.
- The `Identifier` must match what's in your `SMPrivilegedExecutables` key (e.g., `com.yourcompany.helper`).
- In the Entitlements blob, make sure you see `com.apple.security.app-sandbox`.

## Environment Details

- **macOS Version**: 15.x beta (Darwin 25.0.0)
- **Hardware**: Apple Silicon (arm64)
- **Development Tools**: Swift 5.9+, Xcode Command Line Tools
- **Code Signing**: Developer ID Application: Micah Alpern (X2RKZ5TG99)

## What We Suspect

Given that both `SMAppService` and manual `launchctl` commands fail with the same error, we believe this is either:

1. **A macOS 15 beta bug** - The system-level daemon registration mechanism has issues
2. **An undocumented security requirement** - macOS 15 may require additional entitlements or configuration we haven't discovered

## How to Test

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `./build_and_sign.sh` (you'll need to update the Developer ID)
3. Open `build/HelperPOCApp.app`
4. Click "Register Helper"
5. Observe the error in the UI or check `/tmp/helperpoc-app.log`

## Questions for the Community

1. **Has anyone successfully used `SMAppService` for privileged daemons on macOS 15 beta?**
2. **Are there new, undocumented requirements for privileged helpers in macOS 15?**
3. **Is the "Unable to read plist" error familiar to anyone? What was the root cause?**
4. **Should we be using a different approach entirely for modern macOS?**

## Request for Help

We've exhausted all documented approaches and many undocumented ones. If you have experience with:
- `SMAppService` on recent macOS versions
- Privileged helper development
- macOS 15 beta quirks
- Alternative approaches for system-level daemons

**We would be incredibly grateful for any insights, suggestions, or even just confirmation that others are experiencing similar issues.**
