# macOS Privileged Helper with SMAppService - Help Needed! üÜò

This repository contains a proof-of-concept implementation of a privileged helper using Apple's modern `SMAppService` API. Despite following all documented guidelines and implementing numerous fixes suggested by experienced macOS developers, we're encountering a persistent error on macOS 15 beta that we cannot resolve.

**We would greatly appreciate any insights or suggestions from the macOS developer community!**

## What We're Trying to Accomplish

We're building a privileged helper daemon for [KeypathRecorder](https://github.com/keypath/keypath-recorder) that needs to:

1. Register a privileged daemon using the modern `SMAppService` API (replacing deprecated `SMJobBless`)
2. Execute root-level operations (specifically for system-wide keyboard/mouse event recording)
3. Communicate with the main app via XPC
4. Work reliably on macOS 13+ (Ventura, Sonoma, Sequoia)

## The Problem

On macOS 15 beta (Darwin 25.0.0), we consistently get this error:

```
The operation couldn't be completed. Unable to read plist: com.keypath.helperpoc
```

This occurs when calling:
```swift
SMAppService.daemon(plistName: "com.keypath.helperpoc").register()
```

Even more concerning: manual `launchctl` commands also fail with "Input/output error", suggesting a system-level issue.

## Apple Documentation We're Following

We've carefully followed Apple's official documentation:

1. [Updating helper executables from earlier versions of macOS](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/servicemanagement/updating-helper-executables-from-earlier-versions-of-macos)
2. [SMAppService API Reference](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/servicemanagement/smappservice)
3. [Creating a launch daemon](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/servicemanagement/smappservice/daemon(plistname:))

Key requirements from the docs:
- Helper daemon must be in `Contents/Library/LaunchDaemons/`
- Plist must use relative paths for embedded helpers
- Main app must declare `SMPrivilegedExecutables` in Info.plist
- Proper code signing with Developer ID

## Our Implementation

### Bundle Structure ‚úÖ
```
HelperPOCApp.app/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Contents/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Info.plist                    # Contains SMPrivilegedExecutables
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MacOS/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ HelperPOCApp              # Main application
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Library/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ LaunchDaemons/
‚îÇ           ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ HelperPOCDaemon       # Privileged helper executable
‚îÇ           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ com.keypath.helperpoc.plist  # Launch daemon plist
```

### Key Configuration Files

**Main App Info.plist:**
```xml
<key>SMPrivilegedExecutables</key>
<dict>
    <key>com.keypath.helperpoc</key>
    <string>identifier "com.keypath.helperpoc" and anchor apple generic and certificate 1[field.1.2.840.113635.100.6.2.6] /* exists */ and certificate leaf[field.1.2.840.113635.100.6.1.13] /* exists */ and certificate leaf[subject.OU] = "X2RKZ5TG99"</string>
</dict>
```

**Helper Daemon Plist:**
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>com.keypath.helperpoc</string>
    <key>Program</key>
    <string>HelperPOCDaemon</string>
    <key>MachServices</key>
    <dict>
        <key>com.keypath.helperpoc.xpc</key>
        <true/>
    </dict>
    <key>RunAtLoad</key>
    <false/>
    <key>KeepAlive</key>
    <false/>
</dict>
</plist>
```

## Everything We've Tried

### 1. Plist Path Formats
- ‚ùå `BundleProgram` with nested path: `Contents/Library/LaunchDaemons/HelperPOCDaemon`
- ‚ùå `Program` with absolute path: `/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/com.keypath.helperpoc`
- ‚ùå `Program` with relative path: `HelperPOCDaemon` (current implementation)
- ‚ùå `ProgramArguments` array format

### 2. Code Signing & Notarization
- ‚úÖ Signed with Developer ID Application certificate
- ‚úÖ Helper daemon has explicit identifier: `com.keypath.helperpoc`
- ‚úÖ All signatures verify with `codesign --verify`
- ‚úÖ App is fully notarized and stapled
- ‚úÖ `spctl -a -vvv` shows: "accepted, source=Notarized Developer ID"

### 3. Entitlements Attempted
**Main App Entitlements:**
- ‚úÖ `com.apple.security.app-sandbox = false`
- ‚úÖ `com.apple.security.temporary-exception.mach-lookup.global-name`
- ‚úÖ `com.apple.developer.service-management.managed-by-main-app = true` (suspected new requirement)

**Helper Daemon Entitlements:**
- ‚ùå `com.apple.security.app-sandbox = false` (original)
- ‚ùå `com.apple.security.app-sandbox = true` (tested as potential new requirement)

### 4. Manual Testing
```bash
# Direct plist validation
plutil -lint com.keypath.helperpoc.plist  # Result: OK

# Manual launchctl attempts (all fail with "Input/output error")
sudo launchctl load -w /path/to/plist
sudo launchctl bootstrap system /path/to/plist

# Even with simplified test plists containing absolute paths
```

### 5. System-Level Debugging
- Checked for existing services: `launchctl list | grep keypath` (none found)
- Monitored system logs: `log stream --predicate 'subsystem == "com.apple.servicemanagement"'`
- Verified no quarantine attributes
- Checked extended attributes (found Dropbox attrs, but shouldn't affect functionality)

## Environment Details

- **macOS Version**: 15.x beta (Darwin 25.0.0)
- **Hardware**: Apple Silicon (arm64)
- **Development Tools**: Swift 5.9+, Xcode Command Line Tools
- **Code Signing**: Developer ID Application: Micah Alpern (X2RKZ5TG99)

## What We Suspect

Given that both `SMAppService` and manual `launchctl` commands fail with the same error, we believe this is either:

1. **A macOS 15 beta bug** - The system-level daemon registration mechanism has issues
2. **An undocumented security requirement** - macOS 15 may require additional entitlements or configuration we haven't discovered

## How to Test

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `./build_and_sign.sh` (you'll need to update the Developer ID)
3. Open `build/HelperPOCApp.app`
4. Click "Register Helper"
5. Observe the error in the UI or check `/tmp/helperpoc-app.log`

## Questions for the Community

1. **Has anyone successfully used `SMAppService` for privileged daemons on macOS 15 beta?**
2. **Are there new, undocumented requirements for privileged helpers in macOS 15?**
3. **Is the "Unable to read plist" error familiar to anyone? What was the root cause?**
4. **Should we be using a different approach entirely for modern macOS?**

## Request for Help

We've exhausted all documented approaches and many undocumented ones. If you have experience with:
- `SMAppService` on recent macOS versions
- Privileged helper development
- macOS 15 beta quirks
- Alternative approaches for system-level daemons

**We would be incredibly grateful for any insights, suggestions, or even just confirmation that others are experiencing similar issues.**

Thank you so much for taking the time to look at this! üôè

*Note: We understand testing on macOS 14 would help isolate the issue, but we currently only have access to macOS 15 beta. If you've tested similar code on macOS 14, we'd love to hear about your experience.*
