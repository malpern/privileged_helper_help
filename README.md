# macOS SMAppService Implementation - Help Still Needed! üÜò

This repository contains a **systematically verified SMAppService implementation** that demonstrates a persistent Error 108 "Unable to read plist" issue on macOS 15 Sequoia. Despite comprehensive testing, meeting all documented requirements, and achieving full Apple notarization, SMAppService registration consistently fails.

**We need community help to understand what we're missing!** üôè

**Updated July 2025: Complete systematic analysis with production-ready implementation**

## What We're Trying to Accomplish

We're building an app that integrates with [Kanata](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata), a cross-platform keyboard remapper. Our macOS implementation requires:

1. **Register a privileged daemon** using the modern `SMAppService` API
2. **Execute root-level operations** for system-wide keyboard event interception  
3. **Communicate with the main app** via XPC
4. **Work reliably on macOS 15+** (Sequoia and later)

This is a **real-world use case** that should work according to Apple's documentation, but we're hitting systematic roadblocks.

## üö® **The Core Problem**

SMAppService registration fails with Error 108 "Unable to read plist" despite having:
- ‚úÖ **Complete configuration alignment**: All bundle identifiers, plist names, and references match
- ‚úÖ **Embedded helper Info.plist**: With required SMAuthorizedClients configuration  
- ‚úÖ **Full notarization**: Apple-approved Developer ID signing with stapled ticket
- ‚úÖ **Perfect build system**: Xcode project creates correct bundle structure
- ‚úÖ **All documented requirements**: Follows Apple's official SMAppService documentation

## üìä **What We've Systematically Verified**

### ‚úÖ **Complete Technical Implementation**

**Bundle Identifier Alignment:**
- Main app: `com.keypath.helperpoc`
- Helper daemon: `com.keypath.helperpoc.helper`  
- Daemon plist: `com.keypath.helperpoc.helper.plist`
- All references consistently aligned across configuration

**Embedded Helper Info.plist:**
```xml
<key>SMAuthorizedClients</key>
<array>
    <string>identifier "com.keypath.helperpoc" and anchor apple generic...</string>
</array>
```
- ‚úÖ Embedded as binary section via CREATE_INFOPLIST_SECTION_IN_BINARY=YES
- ‚úÖ Verified with `otool -s __TEXT __info_plist`

**Production Signing & Notarization:**
- ‚úÖ Manual signing with Developer ID Application certificates
- ‚úÖ Secure timestamps (`--timestamp` flag)
- ‚úÖ Debug entitlements removed (CODE_SIGN_INJECT_BASE_ENTITLEMENTS=NO)
- ‚úÖ **Successfully notarized by Apple** (status: Accepted)
- ‚úÖ **Stapled and verified** (spctl -a -vvv: accepted)

### ‚úÖ **Verified Configuration Details**

**Helper Daemon Plist (com.keypath.helperpoc.helper.plist):**
```xml
<key>Label</key>
<string>com.keypath.helperpoc.helper</string>
<key>BundleProgram</key>
<string>Contents/MacOS/helperpoc-helper</string>
<key>AssociatedBundleIdentifiers</key>
<array>
    <string>com.keypath.helperpoc.helper</string>
</array>
<key>MachServices</key>
<dict>
    <key>com.keypath.helperpoc.xpc</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

**SMPrivilegedExecutables in Main App:**
```xml
<key>SMPrivilegedExecutables</key>
<dict>
    <key>com.keypath.helperpoc.helper</key>
    <string>identifier "com.keypath.helperpoc.helper" and anchor apple generic...</string>
</dict>
```

**HelperManager Configuration:**
```swift
private let helperPlistName = "com.keypath.helperpoc.helper"  // Matches filename
```

## ‚ùå **Persistent Error Despite Perfect Implementation**

### **Error 108 "Unable to read plist"**
```
Registration failed: The operation couldn't be completed. 
Unable to read plist: com.keypath.helperpoc.helper (Code: 108, Domain: SMAppServiceErrorDomain)
```

**Error occurs when:**
- ‚úÖ App builds and launches successfully (notarized, production-signed)
- ‚úÖ All configuration verified correct via systematic analysis
- ‚úÖ Bundle structure matches Apple's requirements exactly
- ‚ùå SMAppService.daemon(plistName:).register() fails with Error 108

## üîß **Systematic Debugging Process**

### **Issues We've Identified and Fixed:**

1. **Bundle identifier mismatches** ‚úÖ FIXED
   - Problem: Helper using main app's bundle ID
   - Solution: Distinct helper bundle ID with aligned references

2. **Missing embedded Info.plist** ‚úÖ FIXED  
   - Problem: Helper had no embedded Info.plist with SMAuthorizedClients
   - Solution: Created Info.plist with CREATE_INFOPLIST_SECTION_IN_BINARY

3. **Daemon plist naming mismatches** ‚úÖ FIXED
   - Problem: HelperManager referenced wrong plist filename
   - Solution: Aligned filename, Label, and HelperManager references

4. **Production signing requirements** ‚úÖ FIXED
   - Problem: Development certificates insufficient for SMAppService
   - Solution: Full Developer ID signing with notarization

### **Configuration Verification Process:**

**Bundle Structure Verification:**
```bash
# Verified correct structure
helperpoc.app/Contents/MacOS/helperpoc-helper          # Helper binary
helperpoc.app/Contents/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.keypath.helperpoc.helper.plist  # Daemon plist
```

**Code Signing Verification:**
```bash
codesign -vvv --deep-verify helperpoc.app              # ‚úÖ Valid
spctl -a -vvv helperpoc.app                           # ‚úÖ Accepted (Notarized)
```

**Embedded Info.plist Verification:**
```bash
otool -s __TEXT __info_plist helperpoc-helper          # ‚úÖ Contains SMAuthorizedClients
```

## ü§î **What We Still Don't Understand**

### **Root Cause of Error 108**
- **System-level issue**: SMAppService may have macOS 15-specific restrictions
- **Undocumented requirements**: Apple's documentation may be incomplete
- **Runtime vs build-time**: Issue may be in SMAppService implementation, not our configuration

### **Critical Questions**
1. **Does SMAppService require additional notarization steps** beyond stapling?
2. **Are there macOS 15-specific behavioral changes** not documented by Apple?
3. **Does the error indicate a system policy restriction** rather than configuration issue?
4. **Is Error 108 a genuine bug** in macOS 15's SMAppService implementation?
