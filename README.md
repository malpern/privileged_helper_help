# macOS Privileged Helper with SMAppService - Help Still Needed! üÜò

This repository contains a proof-of-concept implementation of a privileged helper using Apple's modern `SMAppService` API. Despite comprehensive testing and following all Apple documentation, **we're still encountering errors and need community help to resolve them.**

**Updated July 2025: Added comprehensive testing results - but still need help with remaining issues!**

## TL;DR: Key Findings

Our research reveals **significant differences** in SMAppService behavior across macOS versions:

### ‚úÖ macOS 15.5 Sequoia (Stable Release)
- **SMAppService API**: ‚úÖ Functional and responsive  
- **Registration Attempts**: ‚úÖ Processes requests (though may fail on code signing validation)
- **Error Pattern**: Specific error codes (-67028) indicating validation issues
- **Developer Experience**: Much better than beta versions

### ‚ùå macOS 16 Beta (Tahoe - Darwin 25.0.0)
- **SMAppService API**: ‚ùå Fundamentally broken
- **Registration Attempts**: ‚ùå Complete failure
- **Error Pattern**: Generic "Unable to read plist" errors
- **Status**: Appears to be a beta OS bug

### üéØ Recommended Target
**macOS 15.5 Sequoia appears to be the most reliable platform for SMAppService development.**

## What We've Implemented (Following Apple's Documentation)

Our implementation follows all documented requirements:

1. **Bundle Structure**: Helper executable and `launchd.plist` in `Contents/Library/LaunchDaemons/`
2. **Plist Format**: Uses relative paths with `<key>Program</key><string>HelperPOCDaemon</string>`
3. **Code Signing**: Developer ID certificate with hardened runtime
4. **Notarization**: Full Apple notarization and stapling
5. **Entitlements**: Proper entitlements including `com.apple.developer.service-management.managed-by-main-app`

## Bundle Structure Overview

```

‚îÇ           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ com.keypath.helperpoc.plist ‚Üê Program: "HelperPOCDaemon"
```

## Testing Results by macOS Version

### macOS 16 Beta (Tahoe - Darwin 25.0.0) ‚ùå

**Error Pattern:**
```
The operation couldn't be completed. Unable to read plist: com.keypath.helperpoc
```

**Symptoms:**
- Complete SMAppService failure
- Manual `launchctl` commands fail with "Input/output error"
- System-level daemon registration broken
- No helpers appear in System Settings ‚Üí Login Items

**Status:** Likely a macOS 16 beta bug affecting core ServiceManagement functionality.

### macOS 15.5 Sequoia (Stable) ‚úÖ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Error Pattern:**
```
Codesigning failure loading plist: com.keypath.helperpoc code: -67028
```

**Symptoms:**
- SMAppService API responds and processes requests
- Specific error codes indicating validation steps
- App builds, signs, and notarizes successfully
- Better compatibility than beta versions

**Analysis:** The error suggests code signing validation issues rather than fundamental API problems. This is a **much better** starting point for development than the complete failure seen in macOS 16 beta.

## What We're Trying to Accomplish

We're building an app that integrates with [Kanata](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata), a cross-platform keyboard remapper. Our macOS implementation requires:

1. Register a privileged daemon using the modern `SMAppService` API
2. Execute root-level operations for system-wide keyboard event interception  
3. Communicate with the main app via XPC
4. Work reliably on macOS 14+ (Sonoma, Sequoia)

## Complete Implementation Details

### Code Signing & Notarization ‚úÖ

Our testing included the full distribution pipeline:

```bash
# 1. Sign with Developer ID certificate
codesign --force --sign "Developer ID Application: [Name] ([TeamID])" \
    --entitlements [App].entitlements \
    --options runtime \
    --timestamp \
    [App].app

# 2. Submit for notarization  
xcrun notarytool submit [App].zip --keychain-profile "Developer-altool" --wait

# 3. Staple notarization ticket
xcrun stapler staple [App].app

# 4. Verify with Gatekeeper
spctl -a -vv [App].app
# Result: "accepted, source=Notarized Developer ID"
```

**Result**: ‚úÖ All steps completed successfully on macOS 15.5

### Key Configuration Files

**Main App Info.plist:**
```xml
<key>SMPrivilegedExecutables</key>
<dict>
    <key>com.keypath.helperpoc</key>
    <string>identifier "com.keypath.helperpoc" and anchor apple generic and certificate 1[field.1.2.840.113635.100.6.2.6] /* exists */ and certificate leaf[field.1.2.840.113635.100.6.1.13] /* exists */ and certificate leaf[subject.OU] = "X2RKZ5TG99"</string>
</dict>
```

**Helper Daemon Plist:**

## Environment Details

**Testing Platforms:**
- **macOS 15.5 Sequoia** (Darwin 24.x) - Stable release
- **macOS 16 Beta Tahoe** (Darwin 25.x) - Beta release with known issues

**Hardware:** Apple Silicon (arm64)  
**Development Tools:** Swift 5.9+, Xcode 16.2, Command Line Tools  
**Code Signing:** Developer ID Application certificate with full notarization

## Key Insights & Recommendations

### ‚úÖ What Works (macOS 15.5 Sequoia)
1. **SMAppService API is functional** - Responds to registration requests
2. **Proper development workflow** - Build, sign, notarize, test cycle works
3. **Specific error feedback** - Clear error codes for debugging
4. **System integration** - Apps can be properly distributed and installed

### ‚ùå What's Broken (macOS 16 Beta)
1. **Fundamental API failure** - SMAppService doesn't process requests
2. **System-level issues** - Even manual launchctl commands fail
3. **Generic error messages** - "Unable to read plist" with no useful details
4. **Complete workflow breakdown** - No viable development path

### üéØ Development Recommendations

1. **Target macOS 15.x** for SMAppService development
2. **Implement full notarization** pipeline from the start
3. **Use Developer ID certificates** (not just development certificates)
4. **Test on stable releases** rather than beta versions
5. **Expect error -67028** on Sequoia and debug from there

## How to Test This Implementation

**üìã Quick Start: See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for detailed setup instructions**

1. **Clone this repository**
2. **Update code signing identity** in `build_and_sign.sh`
3. **Run the build:**
   ```bash
   ./build_and_sign.sh    # Main build script
   ```
4. **Test on macOS 15.5** (recommended) or macOS 14.x

**Alternative**: Open `Package.swift` in Xcode for the best debugging experience.
